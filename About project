I plan to do this project in 4 big stages, first starting with simply researching and listing all of the planets, ships, etc.
The 2nd stage is creating the map and system layout. Starting with placeing the systems and planets and ending with finishing dialog, fleets, etc.
The 3rd stage is ships. Finding or createing the sprites and balanceing them all realisticly to lore, then putting them into factions and fleets.
The 4th stage is missions. Here ill be createing missions and quests based on lore and storyline.
